This is our submission to the CS124H X HackIllinois 2024 hackathon. Made by: Adhi, Enya, Quinn, Raymond.

### Introduction
We felt inspired to create this project because of the food disparity issue in the US. To furfill health standards, many resturants and grocery stores throw out tons of fresh food every day. While this is happening, food banks and shelters struggle to find the food to feed those who need it. We introduce our webapp, *Fresh Start Initiative*, made to connect food producers with these sometthings idk rn

### Front end 
The front end is made with Nextjs, a React framework. We decided to use Nextjs because of it's simple routing as well as the group's overall experience with React and it's frameworks. Most of the components were hand coded, as well as the other pages. Excessive Tailwind was also used.

### Back end

### Setting Up + Reflection
To code this project, everyone on our team was going to SSH onto a singular device. We thought this would be the best idea, because it removes the potential merge conflicts caused by using Git, since many of us would be working on the same file(s). We also didn't use extensions like VSCode Liveshare, because of the different text editors our team used.  

Although this worked somewhat well, it had it's own issues.  

React does this pretty helpful thing where it displays an error on the screen upon detecting, along with the path of the error and the exact line it's on. The website is unable to be accessed until the error is fixed. Since we were technically on the same device, we only were able to have one localhost running, and therefore we had to witness each other's errors. Waiting for other people to fix their errors while you're waiting to test your own components of the code gets annoying, but to be honest this could be fixed with better save practices (ex. ensuring that there are no errors before saving a certain file).  

This also took a lot of time to set up. In potential future hackathons, this should be done prior to the hackathon so not a lot of time is wasted.
