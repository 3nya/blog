I started competitive programming in 10th grade, where I mostly focused on the USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) competitions.  

I coded in Java, and promoted to USACO silver in February 2023. I pretty much never did competitive programming again (except for teaching it in my school's Coding Club and occasional CodeForces competitions).
