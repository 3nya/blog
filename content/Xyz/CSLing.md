## Questions 
**Why did I choose CS+Linguistics?** - I thought NLP was pretty cool and Linguistics is pretty interesting to me. I really enjoyed learning about social sciences (particularly Psychology and Sociology) in high school, and Linguistics isn't *that* far off from those.

**Is this a double major?** - No :) But there is the same amount of technical courses as the pure CS major.
