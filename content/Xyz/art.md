Some people have told me that I don't really look like a CS major, more like an art or architecture major. But they aren't completely wrong.

### Since as long as I can remember...
I was an artist. I loved colors and especially working with oil pastels. When I lived in Flushing, I was enrolled in an art class. The teacher was very strict with his older students, but especially kind around me. I mean, I was in Kindergarten after all.  

The older students always seemed very focused. The middle schoolers were building fundamentals with rigourous pencil and charcoal sketches, while the high schoolers were building their portfolios with any and all types of mediums. I felt very inspired by this, and always wanted to draw the sculptures that lied in the corner of the room. I couldn't wait to get older and do what the other artists did.  

I was moving out of Flushing later that year, and in my last class, my teacher gifted me a large set of acrylic paints. And it wasn't like any cheap art kit that almost everyone gets for Christmas at least once, but a set of decent quality paints in a rainbow of colors. My mom didn't want me to take it, but my teacher insisted, saying it's to support my *"art journey"*.  

On the car ride home, I had the acrylic paints on my lap, admiring the colors of each one. I looked around the box and found a price tag sticker on the bottom of the box. The price was crossed out with Sharpie but under the light it was fairly visible.  

The entire set was near $100, an uncountable number for me at the time, and an amount worth a million dollars for any kid.
